# PythonBotTemplate

You'll need to install the Discord package before being able to use this. This again, is a very very **very** simple beginning to a Discord bot written in Python. Moving forward from here, I suggest reading the documentation for discord.py: 

#### Documentation
https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Moving forward, I may add to this a bit to add simple functions people may use/want to use in their bots, but for now I would like this to be a starting point for people and for the rest to be a learning experience.

## Pre-requisites
- Python >= 3.6 (https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#whatsnew36-pep498))
- Registering your bot on Discord [using this link](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me).
- Pre emptive knowledge, in some way of [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
- Know what a `virtualenv` is and how to set it up
