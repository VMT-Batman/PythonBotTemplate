# PythonBotTemplate

You'll need to install the Discord package before being able to use this. This again, is a very very **very** simple beginning to a Discord bot written in Python. Moving forward from here, I suggest reading the documentation for discord.py: 

#### Documentation
https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Moving forward, I may add to this a bit to add simple functions people may use/want to use in their bots, but for now I would like this to be a starting point for people and for the rest to be a learning experience.
